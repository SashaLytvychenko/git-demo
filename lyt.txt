Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing, ring-ting tingle-ing, too
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling "yoo hoo"
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you


In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr.Snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down
